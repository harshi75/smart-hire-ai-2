Smart Hire AI is an AI-powered hiring platform designed to streamline recruitment with fairness, feedback, and well-being in mind. 
It provides candidates with features like resume screening, interview readiness scoring, job applications, mock interviews, 
skill tests, voice-to-resume (generate structured resumes by speaking), and profile import from GitHub/LinkedIn. 
Organizers can manage postings, shortlist candidates, and ensure fair hiring practices. 

Frontend is deployed via GitHub Pages, and the backend (Flask API) can be deployed on Render/Heroku.
